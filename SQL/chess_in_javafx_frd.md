# Chess in JavaFX

## **[Project Purpose]**

The primary purpose of this project is to enhance our understanding of Java OOP principles and database systems through hands-on, project-based learning. Additional objectives include:

- **To Learn and Apply Knowledge**:
  
  - Gain in-depth knowledge of Java OOP concepts and their practical application.
  - Understand database integration in real-world projects.
  - Document key learnings and insights during the project to reinforce understanding.

- **To Simulate a Real-World Development Experience**:
  
  - Experience project development workflows similar to those in professional software development environments.
  - Practice team collaboration and improve communication skills.

- **To Achieve the Goal Efficiently**:
  
  - Focus on completing a functional version of the project in a goal-oriented manner.
  - After achieving the initial objectives, dedicate time to fixing bugs and adding improvements.

## Project Scope

### **[Functional Chessboard]**

The project aims to deliver a fully functional virtual chessboard that can be played locally, even if features like multiplayer or online connectivity are not yet implemented.

#### **JavaFX/Frontend**

1. **8x8 Square Board**:
   
   - The chessboard must visually represent the classic 8x8 grid.
   - Each square should indicate its position (e.g., a1, h8) for debugging or clarity.

2. **Available Moves Highlighting**:
   
   - Highlight legal moves for a selected piece to assist the user.
   - Visual differentiation (e.g., color or icon) for moves that capture opponent pieces.

3. **Piece Capturing**:
   
   - Implement logic and visual feedback for capturing opponent pieces (e.g., removing the opponent's piece and placing the moving piece on its square).

4. **Castling**:
   
   - Ensure that castling adheres to chess rules:
     - No pieces between the king and the rook.
     - Neither the king nor the castling rook has moved.
     - The path between the king and rook is free from threats (e.g., squares must not be attacked by opponent pieces like bishops or rooks).
   - Visual indicators for valid castling moves.

5. **Pinned Pieces**:
   
   - Prevent movement of pieces that would expose the king to a check (pinned pieces).
   - Visual feedback when attempting invalid moves.

6. **King Movement Under Check**:
   
   - Restrict moves such that the king must get out of check (e.g., by moving to a safe square, capturing the threatening piece, or blocking the attack).

7- Revert or take back moves.

8- Game Over Window.

#### **Java/Backend**

This section will focus on implementing core game logic and exploring Java OOP concepts.

1. **Chess Piece Models**:
   
   - **Class Hierarchy**:
     - Create a `Piece` base class with shared properties (e.g., color, position).
     - Derive specialized classes for each piece type (`King`, `Queen`, `Bishop`, `Knight`, `Rook`, `Pawn`).
   - **OOP Features to Explore**:
     - **Inheritance**: Common behaviors like movement logic shared across pieces (e.g., diagonal moves for `Bishop` and `Queen`).
     - **Polymorphism**: Use polymorphic methods to handle piece-specific behaviors (e.g., `isValidMove()` for different movement rules).
     - **Abstract Classes/Interfaces**: Define abstract methods for movement and capture that each piece implements differently.

2. **Movement Logic**:
   
   - Implement move validation for each piece:
     - **King**: One square in any direction; castling logic.
     - **Queen**: Any number of squares in straight or diagonal lines.
     - **Bishop**: Any number of squares diagonally.
     - **Knight**: Moves in "L" shapes; can jump over other pieces.
     - **Rook**: Any number of squares in straight lines.
     - **Pawn**: One square forward (or two squares for the first move); capture diagonally; en passant logics.

### Areas to consider for the improvements in the future.

**Database**

The database will ensure that game data is persistent and can be resumed later.

1. **Game Record Storage**:
   
   - Store the sequence of moves, player names, and game states in a MySQL database.
   - Consider storing additional metadata (e.g., timestamps, game duration).

2. **Game Resume Feature**:
   
   - Implement functionality to load a saved game state:
     - Recreate the board layout from the database.
     - Restore turn information and other necessary details (e.g., whether castling is still allowed).
   - Allow users to save the game manually or enable auto-save at key moments (e.g., after every move).

---

**Player Management**

- If you plan to add multiplayer functionality later, consider designing a `Player` class now, which can store data like name, color, and move history.

- **Additional Features (Optional)**:
  
  - **Move History**: Add a visual list or log of moves made during the game (e.g., e2 to e4).
  - *Basic AI**: For single-player mode, implement an AI that can make random or strategic moves. For now, we can use already existing AI chess models like stockfish.
  - **Timers**: Include timers for turn-based play.



### Chatgpt's suggestions

### **Gameplay Enhancements**

1. **Difficulty Levels for AI**:
   
   - Implement AI with different skill levels, from beginner to advanced.

2. **Hint System**:
   
   - Provide move suggestions for players who need assistance.
   - Highlight potential threats (e.g., pieces in danger).

3. **Custom Rules**:
