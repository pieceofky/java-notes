**SQL** (Structured Query Language) is a domain-specific language used for managing and manipulating relational databases. It is the standard language used to interact with relational database management systems (RDBMS) like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server.

SQL allows you to perform a variety of tasks, including querying data, updating records, creating and modifying database structures, and managing access permissions. It works by defining structured data in the form of tables, rows, and columns, where tables represent entities (e.g., customers, products), rows represent individual records, and columns represent attributes (e.g., name, price, address).

### Key SQL Concepts

1. **Database**: A container for organizing data in a structured way. It consists of tables, views, procedures, etc.
    
2. **Table**: A collection of related data organized into rows and columns. Each table represents a specific entity type, such as `Customers` or `Orders`.
    
3. **Query**: A request for data or an action, like retrieving, inserting, updating, or deleting records.
    
4. **Primary Key**: A unique identifier for records in a table, ensuring no two rows are identical.
    
5. **Foreign Key**: A field that links one table to another, representing a relationship between the tables.
