Intended to represent a **single function** that can be implemented using **lambda expressions** or method references.

- **One abstract method**: The interface must have exactly one abstract method, which defines the behavior.
- **Optional default or static methods**: It can contain any number of **default** methods (methods with a body), or **static** methods, but they don't count as abstract methods.
- **Used with lambda expressions**: Functional interfaces are typically used as the target types for lambda expressions or method references.
